# zahranlib
A collection of my favourite code.
From deep learning with cv2 to case-insensitive regex. This library has it all.
This is always in development. Whenever I create some new useful code, that will be added to this.

Changelog 3/4/2018, v1.0:
Created the proper version of zahranlib, functions getBlob, processNetForward, checkifjpeg, xy_diff, CaseInsensitiveRegex, grabfrominsta, getTerminalOutput and Timer were added. No bugs or errors. This version has been updated.
